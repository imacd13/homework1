What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge preserves the history of both branches being merged. 
A rebase creates new commits for every commit in the first/original branch, effectively causing you to lose commit history.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a central repository that is used by people collaborating together on code. It has a history like its local counterpart.
